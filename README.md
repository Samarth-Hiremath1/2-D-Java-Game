# 2-D-Java-Game
This is a basic 2-D Java Game where the user controls a spaceship collecting “fuel cells” to escape Earth. Players can use arrow keys or WASD 
to move the space ship. This project was created using Java and the Swing GUI toolkit. I created this as my first attemp using Java Swing in 2022.
